What did you do this past week:

Test, project, and interview. Interview went pretty well, so I'm excited to hear the results. Got things started with the big group project, it's pretty intimidating but the people seem pretty awesome so I'm not super worried. I volunteered to be the first leader in lieu of anyone else volunteering, so it will definitely be interesting to organize stuff and keep tabs on everyone's work. Other than that I decided that I'd focus on the documentation work. We split the work up kind of by task, we will see which tasks prove to be more difficult and time consuming.


What's in your way:

Familiarizing myself with the different tools to be used for the project. I'm not particularly familiar anything but python and SQL so I'll be busy getting at least a basic understanding of each one, since I'll be documenting them and (kind of) managing everyone. Other than that things are pretty relaxed right now with the arrival of Spring break.


What will you do next week:

Visit home, visit friends, work with the group, and have lots of fun!


Tip of the week:

When working with groups, don't be afraid to throw out suggestions to move things along as long as you refrain from being demanding or impatient. Remaining quiet and going with the flow might be a comfort zone but it has little value beyond protecting yourself from (usually) insignificant levels of embarassment.
