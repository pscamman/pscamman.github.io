What did you do this past week:

Was a bit of an easy week, only had one assignment to do. Things are always weird without a Downing project to work on, so I had a lot of free time. Had to drive back here from Houston on Monday morning, so I missed class, but other than that nothing particularly eventful occured.


What's in your way:

I've fallen a bit out of my rhythm. The week was so easy that I'm having a hard time getting myself to get after things now that they're coming back up, such as test studying and projects from other classes. This is something I've always struggled with, but I suppose that just means I'm getting the practice I need for maintaining work ethic in spite of what's going on in my life.


What will you do next week:

A lot. I have a project, a homework, and a test on Thursday. Additionally, I need to get started reading a book for my history class. I don't suspect the test will be particularly hard for me, but I will definitely need to study. The project shouldn't be too hard either, it's the most basic part of the parsing task in my compilers class. Hopefully I'm right about both of those predictions.


Tip of the week:

Keep yourself occupied. It's easy to fall out of sync when there's nothing that really needs to be done for a week or so, and combining that with the fact that you can get things done ahead of time makes it twice as important to be careful.
