title: Week 13

What did you do this past week:

This past week was pretty busy between each project I had. For compilers I had to do an 18 hour coding session (with a moderate break for sleep after the first 12 hours) to complete the project, but I was glad I got it done. For SWE we managed to get the project all done and ship shape, although my time management was a little poor and I missed some group meeting time because of how I did the compilers project. Additionally, I registered for courses and there's a chance I may graduate in the fall! I'm not sure if this is the best choice, and it hinges on whether or not I get an internship this summer, but we'll see how it goes.


What's in your way:

We ended up being assigned to the first day for presentations, so I'm delaying a little more on tailoring and submitting internship applications on handshake. But other than that nothing much really; I'm keeping a very stable sleep schedule and I'm making time to exercise and eat properly.


What will you do next week:

Present, start early on the last compilers project for once (and I really am, I already put some time in heh), and keep things going smoothly. Perhaps I should start studying for the SWE final, but I'm so bad at studying that I always feel like my time is better spent doing something else. I'll just have to make myself do it.


Tip of the week:

It's not about having time, it's about making time.
