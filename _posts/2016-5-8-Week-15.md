What did you do this past week:

This past week was pretty crazy. It was nice that our presentation was out of the way, but I still had a test and a project. I took a couple stabs at the project ahead of time, but I'm still not super good at working on something unless I'm up against the deadline. So Thursday I studied with my group for the SWE test, and then after the test I went home and got to work on my last compilers project. 25 hours later I had it all nice and done and turned it in. What a week!


What's in your way:

Just a couple finals. The compilers final shouldn't be that bad, just a bit of studying will do. The probability exam on the other hand will be pretty hard (the professor is notorious for difficult tests). Additionally, its 40% of the grade so I could technically fail the course completely because of the final. That's pretty rough, I don't like courses that are set up that way!


What will you do next week:

Anything but school


Tip of the week:

Stay in school kids
