title: Week 14

What did you do this past week:

This past week we tied up the project with our presentation. It was a little too bad that we went over on time but I'm mostly just glad to be finished. The project was a lot of fun and a great learning experience but it was also very tiring! I couldn't make it to the next day of presentations but I heard about our critique from group members. Other than that I just tended to regular stuff last week.


What's in your way:

Finals, a paper, and the last compilers project. I'm running out of energy for the semester, but I should have just enough to get these last things done.


What will you do next week:

Finish classes! The paper and the project are due this week, and of course the SWE final is on Thursday. Other than that I just hope to keep my regular routine going and not slip on my good habits. There's not a whole lot to say other than that, it's just last week of classes, finals, and then most likely get ready for the summer semester. Unless an internship magically lands in my lap, that is.


Tip of the week:

Rust is a pretty interesting language, check it out.
